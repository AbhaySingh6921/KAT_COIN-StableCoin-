Stablecoin Project
This repository contains a custom implementation of a stablecoin using the Foundry framework for smart contract development.

ðŸš€ Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a basic yet robust stablecoin system, simulating a fiat-pegged token on Ethereum. It includes:
1=>ERC20-based stablecoin contract
2=>Minting and burning mechanisms
3=>Ownership and access control
4=>Unit and integration testing using Foundry

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Solidity
Foundry (Forge & Cast)
OpenZeppelin Contracts (optional for reusability and security)
chainlink(for real time pricefeed for eth)


#catorgaized of stable coin
```Our stablecoin is going to be:

1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged to the US Dollar
   1. Chainlink Pricefeed
   2. Function to convert ETH & BTC to USD
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting/Burning): Algorithmicly Decentralized
   1. Users may only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   1. wETH
   2. wBTC
```
